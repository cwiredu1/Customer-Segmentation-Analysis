# Data Understanding

- Source Data: Online retail dataset by UCI Machine Learning Library. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail
  
- The dataset has 8 columns and 541909 rows.

- Data Dictionary:

- InvoiceNo: Invoice number uniquely assigned to each transaction.

- StockCode: Product (item) code.
  
- Description: Product (item) name.
  
- Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction.
  
- InvoiceDate: The day and time when each transaction was generated.
  
- UnitPrice: Product price per unit in sterling.
  
- CustomerID: Customer number uniquely assigned to each customer.
  
- Country: The name of the country where each customer resides.

# Data Cleansing

- There are about 25% of Null CustomerID in the data. We need to remove them as there is no way we can get the number of CustomerID.

- There are few records with UnitPrice<0 and Quantity<0. We need to remove them from the analysis. This could represent cancelled or returned orders.

- There is more than 90% of 'United Kingdom' customers, therefore we will restrict the data to only United Kingdom customers.
